Job hunting is intimidating, especially when jumping into a different field! One of the things I found most difficult for me was to properly structure my days and be more productive! The first week after bootcamp I struggled with this, I wanted to do everything on the same day, and at the same time I was doing nothing. After being non productive for that week, I decided to make some changes and set some goals for the week, and then distribute them through the week! So here are some of the steps that I do every week in order to decide my weekly and daily agenda!

**Keep coding**

Refactor your old projects, create new ones, start learning something new or do some challenges! I start my mornings with a big cup of coffee and a codewars/leetcode challenge. This helps to me to think faster, and learn new ways to solve problems. 

Decide how much coding do you want to accomplish that week!! It could go from 1 hour to a few days!!

**Network**

Networking is crucial! I spend between 1-2 days improving my networking skills! 

**Search for jobs**

Search for jobs, compare job descriptions, and contact people!

**Take Breaks**

 Job hunting can be exhausting, so don't forget to separate a day or two to do other things, your brain will thank you!
