I can't believe I'm done with my last project!! These 3.5 months went flying! 

For this project I decided to keep it simple, so I can understand react and redux better!

I built a Winecellar, no user log in required, in which you can see and create wine bottles. I plan on adding more functionality and connect it to another api!
