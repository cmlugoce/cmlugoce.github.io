I graduated from the program some time ago!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰! I decided to dedicate some time to deploy my React project! There are many ways to do this, but I decided to go with the one I felt more comfortable: deploying the backend with Heroku, and the frontend with Surge. 

*Note: I created two separte Github repositories: one for the backend, and one for the frontend!*

### Deploying the backend with Heroku


 Deploying my backend with Heroku went smooth!  Here is how I did it:
 
  **Rails API database configuration**
 
 
 Heroku doesn't support the sqlite3 database, so I changed it to PostgreSQL by doing the following:
 
1.  Replace gem` 'sqlite3'` with gem `'pg'` in your gemfile
2. Specify your Ruby Version in Gemfile like so: ruby "x.x.x". Note: when doing this, make sure your terminal is using the same ruby version
4. Run `bundle install` to update Gemfile and Gemfile.lock file
5. Update `config/database.ym`l to use adapter: postgresql. Your file should look something like this:

```
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  timeout: 5000
  host: localhost
  username: database_username
  password: somepassword   #use an ENV variable
development:
  <<: *default
  adapter: postgresql
  database: your_app_name_development
# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
 
  database: your_app_name_test
production:
  <<: *default
  adapter: postgresql
  database: your_app_name_production
```
 
 
 ** Deploy!!**
 
After setting up my database , and installing the Heroku CLI, I created my project on heroku.

```
heroku login -i           #log into your heroku account
email: blabla@bla.com
password: jmfkenjfli

heroku create 'your_app'     #with this command you can create your project
```


Now is time to deploy!! 

```
git  add.                #keep your repo in heroku up to date
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push heroku
```

Migrate your database, and your seeds (if you have them)

```
heroku run rake db:migrate
heroku run rake db:seed
```

To make sure app is running, type `heroku open` and this will open your app in the browser. 

*Note: go to the URL that you assigned for your JSON*

**Make sure to go back to your `cors` file in `configure/initializers/cors.rb` and add your frontend URL in the `origins`**

### Deploy your frontend with Surge

I love working with Surge! It's super easy to deploy in it! But before getting ready to deploy, I went to my `actions` folder and changed every `localhost:300` to my heroku project URL to retrieve my database info!

I have use many times before, but if you haven't you can follow the instructions [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089).

```
npm run build    
```

Make sure to go to the `build` folder and change the `index.html` to `200.html`

**Make sure to go back to your `cors` file (rails api repo) in `configure/initializers/cors.rb` and add your frontend URL in the origins**

Now is deployment time!!

```
surge               // log in and choose your domain name and deploy!!

 
```

Now you can visit your frontend URL and make sure that everything is working!!!! You can check out mine [here](https://winecell.surge.sh/)
