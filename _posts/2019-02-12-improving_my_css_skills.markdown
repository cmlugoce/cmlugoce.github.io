Welcome back!!  A few weeks ago I decided that it was time to improve my CSS skills. I've been relying on Bootstrap too long (nothing against it, I love Bootstrap)!

I found that there is website, [100 days of CSS](http://100dayscss.com), that has a new challenge every day! They are really nice and it really helps on improving your CSS, and animation skills.

Another thing that I've been doing is to go back to my projects and change the front end! 

So, if you want to improve your skills I suggest you to try the challenges! It's worth it!
