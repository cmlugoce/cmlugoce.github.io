Why do I want to be a Software Developer?
Let’s start from the beginning!!

Since I was a kid I’ve been obsessed with three things: the outdoors, technology, and rocks. I would spend hours looking at sand under a microscope (so cool!!), and describe it in my super notebook!! So, when it was time to go to college, I decided to pursuit Geology as my degree (both B.S. and Master’s).

For several courses in college and grad school I had to make maps using the ArcGIS software. I fell in love with this software because of its efficiency in visualizing and processing spatial data. As I continued working with this, my friends suggested me to learn Python, so I can exploit de ArcGIS potential for my projects, and side projects….and this where the real fun began!!! Teaching me to code was a real challenge, many hours into lectures and code, but I never thought about giving up!

After learning Python I was hungry for more, I couldn’t stop thinking about programming, I wanted a career change! I aspire to combine my love for geology, maps, and coding into a software developer career. I am extremely excited to be part of the Flatiron School web development program!
